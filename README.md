Business Problem: The US healthcare industry is massive, with healthcare spending accounting for over 19.7% of US GDP in 2020. As per Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services predicted that Healthcare expenditures reach beyond $5.7 trillion in the US include payments for all healthcare costs, including pharmaceuticals, equipment, and technology from 2010 to 2026. There has been a gradual drop in the actual percentage increase of U.S. health care costs over the last decade. For 2020, it is estimated that the yearly costs to treat patients increased by 6 percent. However, it is forecast that this will rise to 7 percent in 2021. The costs of healthcare are intrinsically linked to a countryâ€™s healthcare system.
